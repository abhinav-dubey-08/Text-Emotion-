# Text Emotion Predictor

This project is an **emotion prediction model** that analyzes user-provided text sentences and identifies the underlying emotion. Built with advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, this innovative website provides users with emotionally intelligent interactions by accurately classifying emotions.

### Features:
- **Emotion Detection:** Classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more based on the text input.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive website for users to input sentences and view predicted emotions instantly.  
- **NLP-Based Insights:** Uses advanced text processing techniques for precise emotion classification.  

### Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `nltk` (text preprocessing, tokenization, stemming)  
  - `scikit-learn` (machine learning)  
  - `Flask` (web framework for deployment)  

### How It Works:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal are applied to prepare the text data.
2. **Model Training:**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine or Logistic Regression) is trained on labeled datasets containing text-emotion mappings.
3. **Prediction:**
   - When a user inputs a sentence, the system analyzes the text and predicts the associated emotion.
4. **Web Interface:**
   - The model is integrated into a **Flask-based website**, allowing users to interact seamlessly.
